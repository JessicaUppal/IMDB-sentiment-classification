* The dataset we will be using is the IMDB review dataset which has 50k movie reviews, available here : https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
* The dataset provides 25,000  movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. 
* Our project aims to predict whether a review is positive or negative using the natural language processing model.
* First we will apply some pre-processing and carry out some initial data exploration, and determine the ratios of positive and negative reviews using jupyter notebook. 
* We will import the data to an SQL database (if we have time we will get our own data from imdb using scrape
* We will use Pyspark to create a natural language processing model,, apply tokenizer and remove stop words.
* We will train the model on the kaggle dataset, then apply the data we have scraped.

Tuesday 
* Working on scraping the data, data exploration and cleaning.


Thursday 
* Uploading the data into a SQL database, and starting to develop the NLP model


Saturday 
* Continue with developing the model
