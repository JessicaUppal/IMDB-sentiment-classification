      "It's day 592 of Covid-19 Delta and the world has collapsed. Uninfected people were rounded up in camps which ended in disaster. The cities are devastated and bands of pirates are headed out into the country. Aaron (John Malkovich) leads one group searching for a young woman assumed to be immune. She finds a protector in Ben (Jonathan Rhys Meyers).This is a low budget affair. Somebody found a location with a few buildings. They slap-dashed some stuff. Worst still, they slap-dashed a script. The biggest mistake is using the real world situation. They need to use a fictional virus so that they can create a fictional world. It's more than the worlds not matching. They can't possibly get the science right. They need a fictional virus to create movie-logic of their own. The directing is pretty bad. There are a few good actors here who probably had projects canceled on them and needed the work during the pandemic. Malkovich is trying his best but the camera work is bad. It's all pretty bad except for the professional actors working.\n",

      "Wednesday uses Uncle Fester in her experiment for a science fair run by Cyrus Strange. Morticia and Gomez take the family on a road trip and Wednesday is not too happy. Cyrus Strange now claims to be her biological father in a switched-at-birth accident. Gomez tries to stay ahead of Strange's lawyer and keep it secret from Wednesday.I do love these characters but I also wonder if most of that love comes from the live action movies. I do wish that they use some of the live action actors for the voices. As for this story, it's good to center it on Wednesday but it does make the rest of the family more like supporting characters. The better drama is probably Wednesday being kidnapped and the family working together to rescue her. For this movie, the middle meanders around. Their stops are rather random. They go to Niagara Falls instead of Salem. It's not the best choice. I do like the fish-out-of-water aspect of going to Miami beach. This seems to be trying to be Vacation or something. It's not really that good but I still love these characters.\n",

If Mexico is willing to give them asylum, the insanity of hunting and killing them as they attempt to reach the southern border seems a bit inane.

      "LeBron James worked hard to be the greatest and he's not about to let his son Dom be a slacker. Instead of basketball, Dom only wants to be a video game designer. WB's new computer algorithm Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) wants to use LeBron's popularity to dominate the social media space. After LeBron rejects the offer, Al G. Rhythm kidnaps LeBron and Dom into the computer world. LeBron has to play a basketball game to win freedom for himself and his son. LeBron is sent to Tune World where he finds a lonely Bugs Bunny.LeBron is a functional actor and I like the older style Looney Tunes cartoon world. I love the Michael B. Jordan bit. I like some bits in this movie but it's way too long and too much of this is below par. The best part of this movie is Bugs Bunny in his Looney Tunes world and then they go off to various franchises to search for the rest of his friends. I like all of that. I like the animation style. Quite frankly, an animated LeBron James allows him off the hook for his acting. His voice is unique and works well for animation. Turning him in cartoon is a good thing. He doesn't have to act. He should stay a cartoon until he wins the game.His son Dom is a big problem. He's a brat. The excuse is that he gets enticed by Al G. Rhythm but it's a sorry excuse. At no point is he concerned about being in a computer simulation or about his father. The solution lies in Al turning Dom into a monster. When LeBron has his big emotional speech, Dom can slowly turn back into a boy looking to hug his father. That is much better characterization and progression in his story arc.Finally, this movie is hella busy and way too long. It is almost two hours long. The game is almost an hour long. They need to cut out at least fifteen minutes if not more. There is so much chaotic action that the long game section grows tiresome. People are excusing this for being a kids movie. Some of these references are going right over those kids' heads. They are not going to get A Clockwork Orange. For people who get all the references, this is bad for them. For kids who don't get the references, there's no point to it. This movie has fun bits. I love the Looney Tunes animation section. I don't like them digitized into computer animated. The plot is bad simplistic writing. The father son conflict could have been done better. This is way too long and that pushed me over the edge.\n",

As they pursue the investigation, they get trapped in a subway car with four other escape room winners, Rachel Ellis (Holland Roden), Brianna Collier (Indya Moore), Nathan (Thomas Cocquerel), and Theo (Carlito Olivero). It's a tournament of champions. Behind the scenes, Claire (Isabelle Fuhrman) has been imprisoned by her puzzle making father (James Frain) after her mother gets killed in an escape room.I can buy the movie logic of the extravagant puzzle rooms. I don't like it but I can accept it. I can't accept how Zoey and Ben get trapped in the first place. It's completely unreasonable that no other civilian wouldn't just randomly walk onto that train car, even if Minos could trick all those winners into the same place. The other problem continues to be that nobody ever grabs a weapon into the next room. I do like the bank escape room. The beach escape room is too unstructured. The acid rain idea is too ridiculous.

      "It's a nine part TV adaptation of the Stephen King novel of good versus evil. It's not any better than the 1994 version. More money may have been spent but it's not better. The structure is more disjointed which leaves the characters less compelling. I don't like Whoopi Goldberg in this role. The last episode feels stretched out which leaves it without tension.

      "I am not even comparing this to the Greasy Strangler as a movie, just referring to the title ... if anything they are both quite trashy as some would say, but in a different sense. This is quite episodic and I reckon some people who did do drugs, may feel some connection to some of the things happening here. Still it has to be noted, you should not try this at home. And even someone like me, who didn't do drugs (alcohol aside if you think it counts per definition), I could relate ... well understand may be the better word, what the main character goes through, to a degree.Very well played by our lead and far out as some might say. But also completely odd and tough to follow. Also no story - just a few things to be aware of. This isn't anywhere near a \"normal\" film ... but if you let yourself into the world and the madness this depicts ... you can have some fun, with all the depravities you get to see.

      "Greetings again from the darkness. For fans of the 1984 megahit GHOSTBUSTERS, this is the ultimate gift from the brother and sister filmmaking team of Anthony Bueno and Claire Bueno. It's a deep cut \"making of\" feature that takes us behind the scenes for a detailed explanation of just how this comedy-horror-science fiction film made it to the big screen, became such a huge hit, and has maintained such an enduring impact.If you've ever wondered about the origin of the story, you'll be surprised to learn that Dan Aykroyd's great-grandfather was both a dentist and a dedicated researcher of psychic phenomena and the paranormal. This documentary is filled with surprises and insider scoops on everything from the development of the script, the assembling of the crew, the craziness of the special effects team, and finalizing the cast. What makes this different from other 'movies about movies' is that many of the talking heads here are the crew and technicians from whom we rarely have access. There are even segments on the iconic logo and the popular theme song (\"Who you gonna call?\").Of course we also get interviews from the cast, including Aykroyd, Harold Ramis (who passed away in 2014), Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. Mr. Hudson and Ms. Weaver are especially forthcoming - he about how his role as Winston was reduced at the last minute, and she about her audition and game-changing idea for her character Dana, a role she compared to the great Margaret Dumont. Many of the secondary characters offer insight as well, including Alice Drummond, Annie Potts, and William Atherton, the latter since stuck with a not-so-flattering nickname.Director Ivan Reitman recollects many of the challenges, not the least of which were an incredibly tight time line for what was actually an experimental film for the times. They were given one year to formulate a script, secure the locations, finalize the costumes, film the gags, and create the 'monsters'. The famed NYC Firehouse was used for the exterior shots, though a Firehouse in Los Angeles (built in the same year) was used for internal scenes. But the real fun here is supplied by the crew, eager to tell their own stories. The creation of Slimer, with John Belushi eyebrows, is taken from sketch to final. There is an extended sequence on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and the challenges incurred. Ray Parker Jr discusses his rapid work on the theme song, and we even learn about the siren on Ecto-1, the Ghostbusters iconic vehicle.GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE, the sequel to the 1984 original hits theaters this fall, and the sibling Buenos even have a documentary in the works for the GHOSTBUSTERS II (1989). It's disappointing that neither Bill Murray nor Rick Moranis were interviewed for the film, and it's really sad to learn that the salary demands of the great John Candy kept him from appearing in the original film (in the role ultimately owned by Moranis). Sure, we miss hearing the theme song, but this documentary is everything fans of the 1984 comedy masterpiece could want. And you'll have to watch if you want to know the importance of the leopard howl.In theaters October 1, 2021 and On Demand October 5.\n",

Con looses his wife, Annabel, and daughter to a hit and run careless driver, Anton, who also happens to be a drug dealer. Con gets a good look at all 5 people in the car, who speed off-probably on their way to make a drug deal. Con gets depressed and thinks of committing suicide until he gets the idea to go after them and take his own vengeance-instead of calling the police, like most people would do. Since his family died, Con has been working & living at a church where he meets Sarah, a woman that also lost her spouse. Although Con is no professional killer, he seems to hold his own against the bad guys, knocking them off one by one and getting the girl at the end.It didn't have a rating but it contained violence and language and had a running time of 1 hour & 19 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD or even rent.

      "Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend. He's actually an NPC (non-player character) in Free City, an online video game. He goes through every day doing the same thing and getting robbed multiple times. One day, he spots Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer) and his world view expands. In the real world, she is Millie suing Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing her code. She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy.\n",

      "One of the very worst films I've seen in a long time. Impossibly, improbably arty but in an extremely dull, nothing happening kind of way. Couldn't stand the direction from the outset or the constant anachronisms which wear the viewer down. Apparently the idea from this came from the director playing with WILLOW figures in his back garden and that certainly shows. CGI talking animals, bored actors (Dev Patel, what are you up to?) and one good visual with the walking giants. A hated film.\n",

      "Greetings again from the darkness. As the film begins, we understand there will be no happy ending. Anthony Bourdain committed suicide by hanging in 2018 at the age of 61. As it was reported, everyone was shocked. Oscar winning documentarian Morgan Neville (TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM, 2013) interviews those who knew him best, and by the end of the film, we are left wondering why these folks were shocked at how his demise.Bourdain ... called Tony by those who knew him ... spent most of the last 20 years of his life with a camera focused on him, so director Neville allows Bourdain to tell much of his own story. \"I got very lucky\" is how he explains turning a dishwasher job into the position of Chef at Brasserie Les Halles on Park Avenue in New York, and then evolving into an author, talk show guest, and host of TV travel and culinary shows.Perhaps you read Bourdain's first book \"Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly\", or maybe you know him from one of his four TV shows where he traveled around the globe eating strange food and exploring unusual cultures. Then again, to some, he'll always be known as the guy who was filmed eating a live cobra heart. All of those bits are discussed here, but the real interesting segments occur as others talk about the man they knew/loved/worked with.Bourdain's second wife Ottavio, his brother, his friends, his agent, and his production crew are all interviewed here and are surprisingly forthcoming in their recollections and insight into Tony. We even see clips of Bourdain with his daughter, though she is not interviewed. The descriptions add up to a complicated guy. A natural storyteller who was a control freak and hard on those he worked with. Yet he was also charming, immensely intelligent and articulate, and eager to make satisfying TV. He also comes across a bit lost as a person most of the time, never more than when he's filmed asking Iggy Pop, \"What thrills you?\" There is even a segment with Tony in a session with his therapist.The film, and Bourdain himself, don't shy away from his addictive nature. He admits to a drug problem when he was younger, and for the rest of his life he jumped from one non-drug related addiction to another. His personal life seemed to take a turn when he fell for Italian actress Asia Argento and he became an advocate for the #MeToo movement. His tragic end is discussed, and maybe those closest to him were simply too close to see what seems obvious to us now. Director Neville uses no shortage of archival footage and photos, but it's the personal interviews that strike the emotional chord here. Two films, APOCALYPSE NOW and VIOLENT CITY apparently had a dramatic impact on Bourdain, and though the end is tragic, his legacy as an adventurous storyteller lives on.In theaters on July 16, 2021.\n",

      "Greetings again from the darkness. Thanks to (or maybe because of) Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Liam Neeson, we are rarely without a senior citizen action film. However, it's a bit surprising for most of us to see Oscar winner Richard Dreyfuss (THE GOODBYE GIRL, 1977) load up his gun and take to the streets for revenge. Writer-director Adam Lipsius scored a double Oscar coup by also casting Mira Sorvino (MIGHTY APHRODITE, 1995) as Dreyfuss' detective-daughter.\"Based on actual events\", Mr. Lipsius bookends the film with the elderly Ben Myers (Dreyfuss) riding in the back of a limousine. He's barely coherent, but in the opening we can make out, \"If I wake up, I'll choose different.\" We then flashback 12 hours to re-live what is likely Ben Myers' worst day ever. He's been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and though he's a former mobster, he says he went \"legit\" 12 years ago, and runs a local bar with his loyal-to-a-fault sidekick Tommy (the always interesting Pruitt Taylor Vince). Ben's estranged daughter (Sorvino) hits him up for money she says is for the daughter and grandkids that Ben has never acknowledged. Next thing we know, Ben's house has been robbed of all his cash (a quite substantial amount) and trashed by 3 men who take advantage of Ben's beloved dementia-stricken wife Nan (Megan McFarland).This kicks off Ben's mission of revenge. Gun by Glock, body by Devito. His daughter is concerned he's taking this on by himself, and there is the added complication of her working for a politician that Ben once helped out of what would have been a career-ending jam. In fact, there are so many sub-plots, sub-sub-plots and characters who come and go, that much of this makes little sense. It works best when focusing on an aging (former) mobster trying to even the score, and gets a bit shaky when it reverts to dysfunctional family stuff. I believe there are five crying scenes, which is entirely too many for any movie not named SOPHIE'S CHOICE.For those of us who recall Dreyfuss from his early TV days, a brief appearance in THE GRADUATE (1967), and of course in AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973) and JAWS (1975), there is some enjoyment to be had in watching 'Mr. Holland' take a violent approach to revenge ... though he's certainly no AARP reincarnation of John Wick. Overall, it's a pretty generic take on geriatric anger, with bonus points for a spot on description of what it feels like when one's spouse succumbs to dementia.Arrives August 13, 2021 in select theaters, On Demand, and on Digital.\n",

      "The Flash\n",
      "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3107288/reviews?ref_=ttls_li_tt\n",
      "Review of Season One:THE FLASH is another addition to the DC Comics universe, and very similar in scope to ARROW. However, I found this season to be slightly preferable to ARROW; it doesn't have that po-faced seriousness that ARROW has going on, and the characters are more likeable as a result. It's generally a villain of the week kind of picture, although there is a mildly engaging storyline that emerges and comes to fruition towards the climax. The performers are generally confident and ambitious, which helps a lot, although the CGI effects leave something to be desired and there's a certain constraint and repetitive nature to the action scenes due to the superhero's power and in this respect ARROW is the superior show. I was delighted to see some genre favourites, including Liam McIntyre and Clancy Brown, appearing in support.Review of Season Two:Season 2 is a bit of a mixed bag but still generally enjoyable. The writing isn't as strong or consistent as in the first series so it becomes more of a villain-of-the-week kind of format. Some of the other superhuman characters make fun appearances but there's a lack of good guest stars compared to the first season. The supporting cast tend to come into her own here which keeps this watchable.Review of Season Three:Season 3 takes a few more missteps than previously but still proves generally enjoyable. The main problem with this one is the weaker writing, with much more needless family melodrama and a lack of genuine suspense. The constant time travel storylines simply aren't as interesting as those of the previous two series, and the recasting of Wells as a comedy character becomes a little grating. By far the nadir of this season is the ridiculous song-and-dance episode complete with the bloody John Barrowman, no less; what were they thinking?Review of Season Four:Sadly, Season 4 proves to be the worst yet, a mish mash of ideas and tropes that never really gels. The first half of the series is pure filler as Barry gets sent to prison which doesn't really make sense when it comes to the fantasy and sci-fi elements found elsewhere. The obnoxious comedy with Harry's alter egos and the endless romantic elements drag the pacing down considerably. The inclusion of the bendy guy is ridiculous and not helped by appalling CGI effects. The series' villain is a predictable chap borrowed from Marvel and the final element a simple MATRIX copy with more bad FX. A shame that a once-promising show is now becoming so tedious.\n",

      "Bill Hixon is a US Police Chief who has just taken a new job in Boston... not the Boston in Massachusetts but the original in Lincolnshire! Here he is to take over as the Chief Constable of the fictional East Lincolnshire Constabulary. It soon becomes clear that it won't be an easy job; he isn't particularly welcome, with locals fearing he has been brought in to cut costs and thus jobs. Over the course of the series he will have to investigate a variety of crimes; most of which aren't of the type that would feature in a typical US cop show! If that weren't enough he has a fourteen year old daughter who must also settle into a new life far from home.It is clear from the start that this will be a fairly silly series... the very first scene sees our protagonist chase crooks into a cabbage field and start throwing cabbages in frustration! While this isn't a problem there are details that will irritate some viewers... notably the fact that most of the 'locals' have Yorkshire accents and the fact that the way the police behave is very unrealistic; no Chief Constable would lead investigations and junior officers certainly wouldn't get away with talking to him the way they do here. Perhaps a little strangely these flaws didn't bother me as much as I'd expected. The stories are fun but not without their darker moments. Rob Lowe is the undoubted star of the show; doing a fine job as our protagonist; there is solid support from Bronwyn James as DC Muriel Yeardsley, the one local copper who seems to get on with Hixon; young Aloreia Spencer, who impresses as his daughter Kelsey; and Rachel Stirling, as local judge Lady Mary Harborough. The series ends with what I thought was its best episode; this wraps up some storylines but leaves others open for a future series... if there is more I'll watch. Overall I'd say that while this isn't the best British cop show I'd still recommend trying it as different to most shows and set in part of the country rarely seen on television.\n",

But still, I opted to sit down to watch it with my son, as he enjoys superheroes. Whereas I can watch movies with superheroes, but it is not my first choice, as I find superheroes a bit bland.Writers Ernie Altbacker and Tom Taylor actually managed to put together an entertaining storyline. Sure, it was generic in terms of something like this has been seen and done before, many times over. But the storyline told in \"Injustice\" actually proved interesting given the deaths of villains and superheroes alike, as well as the sheer amount of violence and fighting that took place.The art style in \"Injustice\" was good and fluid, and that definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the whole thing. There was a slight touch of good old 1980s cartoon over it, while it managed to be fresh and modern, without it succumbing into a child-like art style, such as seen in the \"Teen Titans Go\" and such.With \"Injustice\" being an animated feature, then having a good voice acting ensemble is alpha and omega. And luckily they had a great ensemble put together for performing the voices for this animated movie. I didn't recognize a single voice though, and having looked through the cast list after the movie ended, I wasn't really familiar with a single performer, for better or worse.\"Injustice\" actually turned out to be a nice surprise, and certainly one of the more enjoyable of DC animated movies, if you ask me. I liked the dark and gritty feel it had, the violence and mayhem, and the fact that it was aimed at an adult audience.My rating of \"Injustice\" lands on a six out of ten stars.\n",

      "Greetings again from the darkness. Whether it's navigating the stairs on all fours, getting a boost up to the saddle of her beloved horse, or showing off her glittery turbans and walking canes, the showmanship of actress Selma Blair seems ever-present despite the severe effects of her Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Documentarian Rachel Fleit films the daily challenges faced by Ms. Blair as she comes to grips with the disease and its impact on her career, her life, and her ability to raise her son.You likely recognize Selma Blair from her most popular movies, CRUEL INTENTIONS (1999) and LEGALLY BLONDE (2001). She admits to viewing herself as a supporting actor, rather than a star, but with 80 screen credits over 25 years, she's certainly worked consistently. But here we see her daily physical and emotional struggles, though her sense of humor is present except for the darkest moments. Cracking wise about Kim Kardashian or Norma Desmond (SUNSET BLVD), and never hesitating to ensure her cane serves the dual purpose of fashion accessory, Ms. Blair keeps us constantly guessing as to whether she is serving up raw emotions or her best performance in the moment.We can easily forgive her if a bit of her good humor is an act. It seems clear the film is designed to be a \"gift\" to her young son Arthur, should her life be cut short. Early on, we witness an MS episode when the stimulus gets to be too much. Her physical contortions and impaired speech are difficult to watch, but necessary for us to fully understand the brutality of the disease.Half of the film is dedicated to her decision to seek stem cell treatment. The process is long and arduous, and we are spared much of the worst that she experiences. Still, it's a weeks-long cycle followed by a two year recovery, with no guarantee of improvement. In fact, no miracle cure or recovery occurs, and Ms. Blair initially seems shocked that she has two years of recovery ahead. It's difficult to believe she had not previously been informed.Selma Blair's slogan, \"We have so much time to be dead\", is a terrific message and she's to be commended and respected for opening up her challenges to the camera. It's hopeful that her willingness to do so will help others, while also educating those unfamiliar with this disease. Mommy issues and extra drama aside, this film is quite something to experience.\n",

      "Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question.\n",

      "It's 8 years after the first movie. The original house has been burnt down. The Blind Man (Stephen Lang) is raising young Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) in a different isolated house. He's overly protective. A creepy man takes an interest in Phoenix and follows her back home with his gang of thugs.I don't mind the first half of the movie. It's interesting to see the story from the other side. I don't like the revelations in the second half of the movie. They are either too convenient or too unlikely. Why can't he just be a creepy child trafficker? The other issue is that the story should stay in that house. The Blind Man should have a way to turn off all the lights in his own home. I really like sneaking around although I don't know how long that could last. I'd rather find out than doing what this movie does in the second half.\n",

      "Bill Baker (Matt Damon) is one of the struggling underclass living in Stillwater, Oklahoma. His oil rig job is gone and he's doing a lowly cleanup job after a tornado. He's respectful to everybody, has two guns, and prays before every meal. Money is tight. He was a bad absentee father but he travels to Marseille, France to visit his daughter Allison (Abigail Breslin) who is in prison for murdering her girlfriend. She claims to be innocent. Bill has a suspect but no one is willing to help. He befriends a young girl named Maya and her mother Virginie (Camille Cottin) helps him as his translator.First, the elephant in the room is the complaint by Amanda Knox. She's entitled to her feelings and I'm sure that it feels bad to have other people take advantage of her story. While this story has some similarities, there are big differences from her story. In addition, this is the father's story more than the daughter's story. Amanda may feel exploited but at best, she is the starting inspiration for the writing of this story.The most compelling aspect is to make this MAGAian character as a sympathetic lead. The world is grinding him down but he still struggles on. He is Sisyphus. Their mantra becomes Life is Brutal. For the movie's first 2/3, his struggling to save his daughter is very compelling. His friendship with Maya is very sweet. The better way to wrap this up would be a sweet tragic turn with Maya. The turn it actually does is too convenient, too setup by the movie, and the movie had moved on. It clashes but I'm willing to live with it until the further twist comes. The twist is a real problem and it retroactively destroys some of the movie's first 2/3. Breslin would be acting differently and her explanation is a little light. It screws up an otherwise great movie.\n",

      "Wow, Mrs. Shullivan and I binged watch the first four (4) episodes of this new TV medical drama series. Of course it is inspirational as well as brimming with emotional storylines in which the majority of the medical professionals are in their mid-30s including the new hire administrator of the New Amsterdam hospital. a doctor named Dr. Max Goodwin (Ryan Eggold).We haven't seen even a tinge of any humor in this TV series to lighten the mood at New Amsterdam. No, quite the contrary, the gas pedal is floor to the metal, as there are quite a few miraculous diagnosis and lengthy Operation Room surgeries and unlike any medical emergency hospital I have ever seen, no one ever gets a bill for their life saving surgery. I have sometimes fallen into a dream sequence reminiscent of all the teary eye miracles and goodwill emphasized on another inspirational TV series, that being Touched by an Angel, 1994-2003.Okay, okay, the results are not real miracles at the New Amsterdam hospital but we can all dream can't we?\n",

      "This very recently became available on Apple TV so my wife and I watched it as soon as it did, streaming via Roku.This is your basic dad and adult daughter caper, she is happily married with two kids in New York but feeling a bit underappreciated by her hard working husband. When she shares an incident with her dad he decides the husband must be cheating and sets out to have him followed. The two of them even follow him to Mexico where he is traveling for business.The dad is wealthy playboy Felix, played by 70-ish Bill Murray and he does it well. The daughter is 44-ish Rashida Jones as Laura, an author unable to get unstuck. Her husband is played well by 48-ish Marlon Wayans as Dean. While the movie in general is executed well and the acting appropriate, I found the story a bit too far-fetched and thus had trouble getting into it. My reaction when it was over was sort of \"so what?\"Just a very inconsequential movie that is somewhat entertaining.\n",

      "A low budget supernatural slasher flick from Brazil, SKULL sees an ancient executioner mask coming back to the present day, where it possesses one of its victims and goes on a killing spree. That's all the plot you're getting in this dark and grimy production which goes for all-out constant gore and ends up numbing the viewer not long in. It's a little like the HATCHET films in their single-minded determination to deliver kill after kill, and it is excessively gory, but these days I like something a little more than that from my horror.\n",
      "Walker\n",
      "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11006642/reviews?ref_=ttls_li_tt\n",
      "This is not really a re-boot of the 1993 long-running TV series \"Walker, Texas Ranger\", with Chuck Norris. Instead it is a \"re-imagining\" of the same character, younger and with children. The old Walker was always at the top of his game, this Walker often seems confused as to what his game really is.Jared Padalecki (also Producer) doesn't bring the same set of skills that Norris did but is a San Antonio native and at 38 is a bit younger than Norris was. He is a good-looking young man but his acting chops are a bit suspect for this kind of role. He must learn the difficult art of being a single parent to two teens. After several episodes my wife and I have a very lukewarm feeling about the series. Something about it doesn't quite feel genuine.Some have questioned the hats. It is an integral part of the uniform for Texas Rangers. To be dressed appropriately, Rangers are required to wear a western hat, a dress shirt, a tie, a dress coat, appropriate pants, western belt, western boots, and the official Texas Ranger badge pinned above the left shirt pocket. An approved handgun should be worn in a waist holster at all times.So my synopsis is ... interesting start, but it is slow to develop much impact, we might quit watching it every week. Once you focus on the fact that stories like this are fictional, just a product of the writer's mind, you keep watching because the characters are interesting and here they aren't that interesting.\n",

      "The story takes place in the near future or so. Thunder Storms are disrupting life and some electronics that humans rely upon. An astronaut (Thomas Jane) and not a robot is attempting to repair a satellite when an electronic buzz blows him back and appears to disrupt the satellite. Meanwhile storm clouds continue in outer space around the planet. We follow a number of disconnected lives on the planet and their relationship with technology. We discover some folks can live forever, while others can not. Androids are used for companions.The ending brings things together, but not too well. There is a message somewhere in all of this, the problem being there are too many messages and they are confused.Guide: F-word. Sex. Brief nudity (Garance Marillier)\n",

      "Now, I wasn't really sure what I was in for here, as I sat down to watch the 2021 movie \"Snakehead\". But still, with \"Snakehead\" being a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I found the time to sit down to watch it.And as it happens to turn out, then \"Snakehead\" was actually rather enjoyable. Writer and director Evan Jackson Leong managed to put together a very interesting and entertaining storyline where there were many ups and downs along the way, making it a non-linear ride. And Evan Jackson Leong also managed to put together a group of interesting and very detailed characters, along with some good and believable dialogue. And I will say that it was nice to see the writer and director take an alternate approach to showcasing human trafficking and a crime syndicate in China Town.So yeah, I was genuinely entertained by what \"Snakehead\" delivered.It should be noted that the movie's cover is very much reminiscent of an 1990s action movie, which sort of is presenting a wrong presentation of the movie. So don't let the movie slide your interest just because of the cover.The movie has an all-together impressive ensemble of casted actors and actresses. The movie was especially nicely carried by the performances of Shuya Chang (playing Sister Tse) and Jade Wu (playing Dai Mah). But also with the likes of Sung Kang and Yacine Djoumbaye, then you are in for an entertaining movie with good performances.While \"Snakehead\" is listed as an action crime drama, which it essentially is, the main focus of the movie is the crime and the drama, whereas the action is just an added layer.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch \"Snakehead\", if you have the chance. I was genuinely entertained by it, and it turned out to be a movie that sinks in under the skin.My rating of \"Snakehead\" lands on a six out of ten stars.\n"
